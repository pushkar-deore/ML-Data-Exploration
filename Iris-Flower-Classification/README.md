# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This project is a classic introduction to supervised machine learning. The goal is to classify iris flowers among three species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* — using their petal and sepal measurements.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Predict the species of an iris flower based on the following features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for modeling)

---

## 📊 Workflow

1. **Data Loading**  
   Used the built-in Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized feature distribution and correlation using scatter plots and pairplots.
   - Checked data balance across classes.

3. **Model Building**  
   Implemented and compared three classification algorithms:
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Logistic Regression

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report

## ✅ Results

| Model               | Accuracy |
|--------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression| 96.67%   |
| K-Nearest Neighbors| 96.67%   |
| **Support Vector Machine** | **97.33%** |

📌 **SVM performed the best** among all three models.
